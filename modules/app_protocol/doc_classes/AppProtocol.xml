		App protocols let you register urls for your application to browsers and desktop applications.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		When you declare a protocol it lets you launch via web links in browser (with permission)
		You can implement protocols for windows,mac and linux and have a uniform API for this.
		On Mac you must register the binary at export time, so we enable this primarily after you execute and run your game.
		The idea is you go to a website and click a link and your game opens, but additionally will pass data
		from your browser to an already running game via an IPC library
